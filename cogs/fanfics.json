	"Twilight had just risen out on the beachfront.  Various beachgoers were enjoying themselves, playing in the water, eating some foodstuffs at the snack bar, or just relaxing for a tan.  Magic was in the air, and things were about to take an unexpected turn.\n\nEnter {0}.  {0} was lying on the beach, letting thoughts drift in one ear and out the other.  {0} didn't have much of anything to do at the moment.  In fact, {0} was beginning to feel quite lonely, and longed for some attention, or at least, someone to spend the sunset with.  {0} let out a sigh of despair.  The sun was going down, and soon, everyone would be covered under a blanket of stars.\n\nJust when {0} was about to break from the loneliness, {1} appeared.\n\n\"Alone?\" {1} asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" {0} responded.\n\nIt was at that moment that their eyes met.  They gazed into each other's eyes for what seemed to be an eternity.  After an never-ending silence, {1} reached for {0}'s hand.  It was as soft as silk.  {1} stooped lightly to kiss it.\n\nBefore anyone knew it, {0} and {1} were locked in a firm embrace.  {0} lightly kissed {1}'s forehead, while {1} laid hands on {0}'s supple chest.  Before long, both of their shirts were off, and their loins were locked in a labor of love.  It would come to be known as the wildest night of both their lives.",
	"{0} was sitting down in at home, resting on a black leather couch, when suddenly the doorbell chimed. {0} walked up to the door, curious to see who was there. When {0} opened the door, however, {0} was greeted by the all-too-familiar presence of {1}. {0} realised this and shut the door; however, {1} clawed through the door, and demanded to talk about their sexual relationships.\n\n\"Why did you abandon me? I was only there to help you.\" {1} sensually stated, eyes laden with tears and arousal.\n\n\"Things change, {1}, but you have to accept it. I'm in love with someone else now.\" {0} replied sternly, glaring at {1}.\n\n\"I thought you loved me!\"\n\n\"I did too, but you simple weren't my type.\"\n\n\"WHAT DID I DO WRONG?!\"\n\n{1}, crying sensually, reached into a pocket and pulled out a small, blue box complimented with a silky red ribbon.  {1} held it up to {0}, for both of them to see.\n\n{0} opened the box to reveal a green wedding ring. {0} gazed at the handcrafted marvel.\n\n\"It's beautiful.\" {0} complemented breathlessly.\n\n\"{0}... I... don't know how to explain this to you... Will you marry me?\"\n\n\"Yes!  I will marry you!\" {0} cried.\n\n\"I can't believed we're getting married!\" {1} shouted, as a limo drove over to pick up the lovebirds.\n\n\"I can't believe it either,\" {0} mumbled, lovestruck.",
	"\"{0}, eat your greens,\" {1} demanded while shoving spinach into {0}'s face. {0} looked down at the vegetable in disgust, then looked up at {0}, \"Are you fucking serious?\" {0} asked sharply.\n\n\"Watch your fucking language and eat your damn greens,\" {1} responded back.\n\n{0} pulled out an AK-47 and pointed it at {1}'s face, \"How about you eat my damn bullets, instead?\"\n\n\"Jokes on you, I eat bullets for breakfast,\" {1} deadpanned.\n\n\"Let's test out your theory, then.\"\n\n{0} pulled the trigger and shot dozens of bullets that were meant to hit {1}. However, {1} opened his mouth and consumed all of the bullets unharmed.\n\nSweat began to pour down {0}'s face.  {0} tried to shoot {1} again, and once again, {1} ate all of the bullets without getting injured.\n\n\"How is this even possible?!\" {0} exclaimed.\n\n\"Well... I think it's time that I, told you the truth,\" {1} started, \"You thought that I was just a mere mortal,\" {1} pulled off his face, which was actually a mask, and revealed his true self, \"But it was me, **DIO!**\"\n\nDio slammed a steamroller on {0}, killing him instantly.\n\n**WRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY**\n\nThen the two proceeded to have furious anal, and everyone lived happily ever after.  The end."
